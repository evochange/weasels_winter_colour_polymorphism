# Treemix input from ANGSD .mafs output

This folder contains the python scripts used to generate an input file for [Treemix](https://bitbucket.org/nygcresearch/treemix/wiki/Home) from allele frequencies files (.mafs) generated with [ANGSD](http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/ANGSD).
* A .mafs file from each population under analysis is required.
* It's assumed that the .mafs files were produced using the ancestral state (ancestral reference provided with -anc) as major allele (-doMajorMinor 5).

Scripts should be run following their numbering order. Specific usage instructions are provided within each script.
