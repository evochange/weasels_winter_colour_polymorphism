# Winter colour polymorphism genomics

This repository contains custom-made scripts used for analysis of WGS data from least weasels (*Mustela nivalis*) for population genomic analyses and mapping of adaptive traits. Available data included low-coverage individual whole-genome sequencing. These data were analysed at the population level by combining data from individuals of the same population into a single file.

The scripts included here were used to:

1. Create input files for [Treemix](https://bitbucket.org/nygcresearch/treemix/wiki/Home) software from allele frequencies estimated with [ANGSD](http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/ANGSD) software.

2. Create input files for [SweeD](https://cme.h-its.org/exelixis/web/software/sweed/) software from allele frequencies estimated with [ANGSD](http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/ANGSD).

All python script use python2.7.
